# KiraKira – Digital Emotional Garden

KiraKira is a calm, mobile-first mood companion where every daily check-in plants something new. Your emotions become a living garden—soft shapes, stones, and glows that shift with mood, season, and consistency.

## What you can do

- Log one mood per day (Joy, Calm, Stress, Sadness, Anger, Anxiety) with intensity.
- Watch your garden evolve with seasonal looks and rarity tiers that reward gentle consistency.
- Keep a lightweight streak and reward system that encourages reflection without pressure.
- Use it anywhere: installs as a PWA, works offline after first load, touch-friendly by default.
- Connect through the Telegram Mini App for theme alignment and optional cloud sync.

## How it works

1. Choose your mood and intensity for the day.
2. KiraKira adds a new element reflecting that mood.
3. Over time you see a visual timeline of how you feel.
4. Seasonal variants and rarity add subtle variety while keeping the experience calm.

## Principles

- Privacy-first: data stays on your device unless you opt into Telegram sync.
- Gentle by design: no harsh penalties for missed days, just encouragement.
- Accessible: responsive layout, large touch targets, respects reduced-motion settings.
